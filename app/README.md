### Note:
I do have developed a full fledged end to end photo/video sharing mobile application named Chillaavo with support to messaging, push notifications, commenting on posts, blocking users and such more features like in today's social media application with flutter and Firebase suite.
I'm happy to discuss about that app if we get chance to meet in person(virtual).
